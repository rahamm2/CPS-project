CPS Project Report 
Greenhouse Monitoring System 
This project aims to monitor Temperature and Humidity of the Greenhouse. The purpose of the project is to use Wi-Fi chip ESP 8266 to create the dashboard with Adafruit as we do not have MKR1000. In this project, we utilized humidity and temperature sensors that connected using the Arduino controller to create feed, upload to Cloud, and create the dashboard using the block settings. With this dashboard, one can monitor live temperature and humidity reading using the different sensors at a different time interval. A line chart uses to represent trends in temperature and humidity changes to further visualize the data. Whatâ€™s more, we also installed two actors to the monitoring system which are a DC motor driven fan and a water pump, the fan attempts to cooldown the green house temperature, and the water pump attempts to increase the humility. In the below content, we are to illustrate the detail design of this project.
